📌 User Flow (How the Bot Works)
1️⃣ Start & Channel Verification
1️⃣ User starts the bot (/start).
2️⃣ Bot checks if they joined the required channel (@YourChannel).

If joined, bot proceeds.
If not joined, bot asks them to join with inline buttons:
sql
Copy
Edit
⚠️ You must join @YourChannel to use this bot!
✅ [Join Now]  
🔄 [Check Again]  
3️⃣ After joining, bot welcomes the user:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
🔮 Welcome! Select an app to start predicting.
2️⃣ Selecting App & Game (Inline Mode)
1️⃣ User selects an App (e.g., 1win, Bet365, Fun88).
2️⃣ User selects a Game (e.g., WINGO, K3, XYZGAME).
3️⃣ Bot asks for last 10 results (only required once)

For WINGO: Big/Small
For K3: Big/Small + Odd/Even
4️⃣ User enters last 10 results.
5️⃣ Bot checks all stored patterns and predicts the best result.
3️⃣ Prediction & Validation
✅ Bot sends predicted result with inline buttons:

yaml
Copy
Edit
🔮 Prediction: Big  
✅ [Correct]  ❌ [Wrong]
✅ If user confirms the prediction is correct:

The bot automatically updates last 10 results.
The bot logs the correct prediction in the admin channel.
✅ If the user tries to predict again before cooldown ends:
The bot shows remaining cooldown time and prevents spam.
🔹 Example Log Message in Admin Channel:

yaml
Copy
Edit
✅ Prediction Log  
🏆 App: 1win  
🎰 Game: WINGO  
🔮 Predicted: Big  
🎯 Correct ✅  
4️⃣ Real-Time Auto-Update of Last 10 Results
✅ Users enter last 10 results ONCE.
✅ If a prediction is confirmed correct, the bot updates last 10 results automatically.
✅ No need to re-enter results every time.

🔹 Example Update Flow:

User inputs:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Big, Small, Big, Big, Small, Big, Small, Small, Big, Small
Bot predicts:
yaml
Copy
Edit
🔮 Prediction: Big  
✅ [Correct]  ❌ [Wrong]
User clicks "Correct" → Bot updates their last 10 results:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Small, Big, Big, Small, Big, Small, Small, Big, Small, Big
(Oldest result removed, latest added at the end.)
5️⃣ Multiple Pattern Matching System
✅ Admin can add 10-60 patterns per game.
✅ Bot checks all stored patterns and selects the best matching prediction.

🔹 Example Patterns for WINGO:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Big, Big, Small, Small, Big → Small  
Small, Big, Big, Small, Small → Big  
Big, Small, Big, Big, Small → Small  
🔹 Example Patterns for K3:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Big Odd → Small Even  
Small Even → Big Odd  
Big Even → Small Odd  
If multiple patterns match, the bot selects the most frequent correct outcome.
✅ Admin can update or remove patterns anytime.

🔹 Admin Command to Add Pattern:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
/setpattern WINGO [Big, Big, Small, Small, Big] → Small  
🔹 Admin Command to Remove Pattern:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
/removepattern WINGO [Big, Big, Small, Small, Big]  
6️⃣ Per-Game Cooldown System
✅ Each game has a separate cooldown.
✅ If a game period changes every 30s, 1min, or 10min, admin can set different cooldowns.
✅ If user tries to predict too soon, bot shows time left.

🔹 Example Cooldown Settings:

bash
Copy
Edit
/setcooldown WINGO 60  
/setcooldown K3 180  
/setcooldown XYZGAME 30  
WINGO = 1 min
K3 = 3 min
XYZGAME = 30 sec
✅ Admin can remove cooldown if needed:

bash
Copy
Edit
/setcooldown WINGO 0  
7️⃣ Admin Panel (Bot-Based)
Command	Function
/setcooldown <game> <seconds>	Set cooldown per game (e.g., WINGO = 1min, K3 = 3min)
/setpattern <game> <pattern> → <result>	Add multiple patterns for any game (Bot finds best match)
/removepattern <game> <pattern>	Remove a pattern from the game
/addgame <GameName>	Add a new game dynamically
/deletegame <GameName>	Remove a game
/setfree <X>	Set free predictions per user

8️⃣ Forced Channel Join
✅ Users must join a required channel before using the bot.
✅ Admin sets the required channel:

Edit
/setchannel @YourChannel
✅ If a user tries to use the bot without joining, the bot prompts them to join.
